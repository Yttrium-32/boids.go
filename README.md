# Boids Simulation in Go
This project implements a real-time Boids simulation in Go using the
[raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) graphics library. It
demonstrates emergent flocking behavior using simple local rules: alignment,
cohesion, and separation.

Based on my similar project in python: https://github.com/Yttrium-32/boids.py

## Usage
#### Either run:
```bash
go run main.go
```

#### Or with GNU Make installed:
```bash
make
```
